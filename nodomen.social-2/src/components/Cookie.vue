      <h2><strong>What Are Cookies</strong></h2>

        how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can prevent these

      <h2><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h2>

        standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to
        this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in
        case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

      <h2><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h2>

      <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for how
        to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that
